# How to contribute? 

First off, thank you for considering contributing to asuu.me. Let's count the :star2:s together. 

* If you've found a bug in the code, open an issue
* Wanna build new feature? Add that feature to the project's [To do list](https://github.com/zolbayars/asuu.me/projects/1). Then create a new branch and code right away :)
